# Intro


## Idea 

On my Money and Banking class at the University of Minnesota Terry Firzgerald has shows us the [FedWatch tool by CME](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html). This tool shows the probability distribution of the implied FedFundsRate hikes before FOMC meetings. I wanted to replecate this, because it seemed itneresing, looked at the [methodology](https://www.cmegroup.com/education/demos-and-tutorials/fed-funds-futures-probability-tree-calculator.html) and found out that CME is not upfront about how exacly they are getting the data. 

## Implementation 

Later on I decied that it would be pretty convenient and cool to see how the implied trajectory of the fed funds rate changes over time. In order to do this I downloaded the futures historical prices from [yahoo finiance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ZQ%3DF/futures?p=ZQ%3DF) using [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/), conducted some algebraic operations on the data and plotted the trajectories using [ploty](https://plotly.com).
